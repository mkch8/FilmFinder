                    <h4>What is FilmFinder?</h4>
                    <p> FilmFinder is a film recommendation website. You can select a mood, and an algorithm will
                         generate films for you to watch based on the chosen mood. Not only that, it will compare the
                         films you've watched to our database of movies and the preferences of other users.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Do I need to create an account to use FilmFinder?</h4>
                    <p>
                         Yes, you will need to create an account to use FilmFinder as the algorithm takes into account
                         your preferences.

                    <h4>How does the algorithm work?</h4>
                    <p>
                         The mood of each film is generated using a transformer model through analysing each film's
                         genre, overview and keywords. When a mood is selected, we filter movies for the specified mood
                         and combine this with content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. In simpler terms,
                         we compare what you have liked in the past to similar movies, but also compare your interests
                         to other users in the database.
